== Make Code Readable

[.ppt]
* As Any Writing, Code Tells Something.
** It can tell **what** and **how** it does.

[.fragment.ppt]
* Let The Code Tell The Story
** The more **self-explanatory**, the more **easy** to maintain.

[.fragment]
You read 10 more than you write

[.fragment.ppt]
* You write once, but you read
** to _check_,
** to _understand_,
** to _remember_,
** to _copy_,
[.fragment]
** and to _**rewrite**_.
