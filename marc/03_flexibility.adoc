== Flexibility

* Why do you need flexibility ?
** flexibility for change
** flexibility for evolution without breaking anything
** Don't break everything

[NOTE.notes]
--
* Delimit the perimeter
* Tell What it does, don't think about how it's done.
* Engage for interface, not (yet) about implementation
* Keep the freedom of experimentating
* => interface

== Coupling

When any change to one component implies to modify the other one.

* When components are tightly coupled
** Evolving one can quickly become a nightmare.
** Side effects will be numerous and discouraging.

[.fragment]
--
For a few components, it doesn't really matter.

== Coupling

But with a lot of components, it would turn into a nightmare !

== How to decouple ?

In software, coupling means you're bound by too much knowledge.

* Limit required knowledge
** To be linked to the *WHAT* and not to the *HOW*.
** Use indirection
** Fire and Forget

The WHAT if the promise, the HOW is the implementation.





== Limit required knowledge

Two main ways of doing
* Fire and forget
* Indirection

== Fire and Forget

* Send something to a

The best solution is
that *A* is not related +

but *to* what it [.huge]#offers#.

[.fragment]
To use a kind of [.huge]#contract#.

[.fragment]
It describes [.huge]#WHAT# dependency does +

If the camera is changed to a _very_ different modele, +
Camera Operator has certainly to _be adapted_.

The better is to relate to a _camera contract_,
instead of a _camera model_.

Contrat => [.huge]#interface#.

[.left-column]
[.center]

So camera model could be changed, +
as long as it _implements_ the required *interface* +
we don't care.

And we could make easy our tests +
of Camera Operator +
without *hacking* a real camera.

[.fragment]
We just have to use a Mock Camera implementing _Camera Interface_.
--



== Conclusion of abstraction

* To gain flexibility
** Be linked to the contract, the interface, not the implementation.



[NOTE.notes]
--
* In real life
** If you have a very simple dependency, don't bother with interface.
** Use *interfaces*
*** when there's several implementations,
*** _or_ delicat, complexe, heavy dependencies,
*** _or_ depenceny is hard to mock in tests.

But if you're in a field +

you would prefer talking about _Reporting camera_.

How to reconcile the two universes ?

a _Microphone interface_ too.
