== Why a talk about good practices ?

* Developping is turning human ideas into computer code
** for the sake of simplicity
* There's several way of doing it
** A lot of them have been followed by a lot of people,
** Some of them lead to disaster
** other to a kind consensus
* We call them the _good practices_
** It's preferable to follow some of them
* Because developement could be tricky

== What are the challenges of development ?

* To handle complexity,
* To successfully translate human ideas into computer code
** and back
* To ensure that software is doing what is expected to do,
* To allow changement and evolution
** To not be afraid to break everything

== Why it so tricky

Because of our human nature

Remember...

== Why Are We Building Software ?


[.fragment]
--
* Because it's a very powerful tool
** To do stupid or boring or endless stuff,
** To Perform calculations quickly,
** To achieve objectives,
** To satisfy needs,
** To apply a vision of the world,
** ...
--

[.fragment]
--
* We make software to turn *ideas* into *action*.
--


== Why It Could Be Tricky To Build Software ?

[.fragment]
--
* Sometimes we fell
** lost along the way between the original ideas and the code,
** Not being really convinced of the result,
** Afraid to break something.
--

[.fragment]
--
* This is largely due to problem of
** Translation
** Complexity
** Evolution

[NOTE.notes]
--
We all observe that it's no easy to build software.

=== Lost In Translation

[.fragment]
--
* Translate *ideas* into *code*
** As the Italian say "Traduttore, traditore" -> _Translator, traitor_
--

[.fragment]
--
* Translation Implies Distorsion
** The further _away_ from the code, the _greater_ the distortion.
** To _convert_ and _adapt_ into code => To _modify_ or _lost_ the meaning of our original ideas
--

[.big]
[.center]
We could get lost in *complexity*.


[NOTE.notes]
--
Software is a tool to put ideas into action. But we have to convert our ideas into code to make them concrete. We have to translate a intellectual building into an computing piece of code, but translation is a kind of betrayal : "Traduttore, traditore".
We imply distorsion of our original ideas.

=== Overwhelm By Complexity

=== Overwhelm By Complexity

[.fragment]
--
* Complex vs Complicated
** _Complex_ as opposed to _simple_ => _indirect_,
** _Complicated_ as opposed to _easy_ => _difficult_.
--

[.fragment]
--
If _complexity_ is not a problem, _complication_ should be avoided.
--

[.fragment]
--
* Abstraction, Complixity, Complication
** The more _abstract_ are ideas, the more _complex_ is implementation.
** The more _complex_ is implementation, the more _complicated_ *may be* the code
--

[.fragment]
--
In general, _complexity_ leads to _complication_ if you are not careful.
--

[.fragment]
--
So be careful...
--

[NOTE.notes]
--
There is always some confusion between Complex and Complicated.
Complex can be opposed to simple while complicated can be opposed to easy.
Software can be complex, because the implementation of the underlying ideas requires several steps or depths.
But such architecture is not complicated, it is just not direct.
On the contrary, a simple idea could be complicated to implement as software, could be very tricky and difficult to write, to understand.

In general, complexity leads to complication if you are not careful.

=== Be Afraid To Break Everything

image::images/marc/break_everything.gif[]

=== Be Afraid To Break Everything

* Software is *ever* in *evolution*
** It is not written in one and unique time, and that's all !
* As _experience_ and _ideas_ evolve, software has to follow,
** So it have to be changeable.

[.fragment]
--
* A software that can not evolve is a fragile one.
--

[.fragment]
--
* => Be careful to make your code changeable...
--


[NOTE.notes]
--
* Software is an investissment
** Software is ever in evolution, it is not written  in one and unique time, it still evolving, like a very strange kind of animal, adapting to new needs or ideas, and like in darwin evolution, still  keeping some odd and old features, artefacts or piece of useless codes.
**  So make it running is not enough.

== What Are The Good Practices ?

[NOTE.notes]
--
* People have been building software for 40 years.
* People gather a pretty big set of principles, recipes, experiences built by severals years of try and fail.
* Unless you're a genius, it's worth it to start using them before creating your own path.
