== Why a talk about good practices ?

* Developing is turning human ideas into computer code
** for the sake of simplicity
* There's several way of doing it
** A lot of them have been followed by a lot of people,
** Some of them lead to disaster
** other to a kind consensus
* We call them the _good practices_
** It's preferable to follow some of them
* Because developement could be tricky

== Why it's so tricky ?

== Mainly because of our human nature

* First processor is human brain

* Good Points
** It detects patterns, similarities,
** It learns, extrapolates and generalizes quickly.


* Not So Good Points
** Short-memory buffer limited to "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two",
** Hates repetitive tasks without interest,
** Get quickly lost by arbitrary,
** cognitive and cultural biases we have to deal with.

So if we ignore our capacities, we empty the ocean with a small spoon.

== What are the challenges of development ?

* To handle **complexity**,
* To successfully translate human ideas into computer code
** and vice versa
* To allow changement and evolution
** To not be afraid to break everything
* To ensure that software is doing what is expected to do,



== How to handle this ?

* By following some good practices among a lot of them.
* By applying them into these fields
** Brain food
** Attitude
** Conception
** Coding
** Testing
