== Why a talk about good practices ?

* Developing is turning human ideas into computer code
** for the sake of simplicity
* There's several way of doing it
** A lot of them have been followed by a lot of people,
** Some of them lead to disaster
** other to a kind consensus
* We call them the _good practices_
** It's preferable to follow some of them
* Because developement could be tricky


== Why it so tricky ?

== Mainly because of our human nature

* First processor is human brain

* Good Points
** It detects patterns, similarities,
** It learns, extrapolates and generalizes quickly.


* Not So Good Points
** Short-memory buffer limited to "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two",
** Hates repetitive tasks without interest,
** Get quickly lost by arbitrary,
** cognitive and cultural biases we have to deal with.

So if we ignore our capacities, we empty the ocean with a small spoon.

== What are the challenges of development ?

* To handle **complexity**,
* To successfully translate human ideas into computer code
** and vice versa
* To ensure that software is doing what is expected to do,
* To allow changement and evolution
** To not be afraid to break everything


== How to handle this ?

* By following some good practices among a lot of them.
* By applying them into these fields
** Brain food
** Attitude
** Conception
** Coding
** Testing

== Be kind to our brain

[NOTE.notes]
--
We have to be kind our brain.
We have to help our brain to cope with all that stuff.

== Do Not Overload Mental Mapping

== Give Regularity And Consistency

== Don't get lost in translation


[.fragment]

* Translate *ideas* into *code*
** As the Italian say "Traduttore, traditore" -> _Translator, traitor_

* Translation Implies Distorsion
** The further _away_ from the code, the _greater_ the distortion.
** To _convert_ and _adapt_ into code => To _modify_ or _lost_ the meaning of our original ideas

== Help it to do not fear to act

* Fear limit our creativity

== Freeze The Brownian Motion Of Ideas

* In our times, we have to work in parallel
* A lot of moving and unfixed ideas

[NOTE.notes]
--
* The conception is like a game.
* We all of us have a lot of ideas.
* We all of us have biases.
* "ecrire c'est ranger le bordel qu'on a dans la tÃªte"
* "writing is putting away the mess in your head"
* "to describe is to put away the mess in your head"
* => Draw boxes with arrows
* => write down what do you want to do
* Talk to your colleges
