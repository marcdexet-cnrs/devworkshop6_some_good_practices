[.ppt]
* Because turning ideas into code could be tricky !
* Many ways have been tried by people,
** Some of them lead to *disaster*,
** Others to a *consensus* about how to _avoid_ disaster.

[.ppt]
* They're the *_good practices_*
** It's preferable to know some of them
** Regardless of your experience :)

== Mainly Because Of Our Human Limitations

[.ppt]
* Remember Human Brain
** First processor to turn human ideas into computer code

[.fragment]

* Good Points
** It detects patterns, similarities,

== Good practices discussed ?


There's too much to say.

* We will focus about
** To successfully *translate* human ideas into computer code
** To handle **complexity**,
** To not be *afraid to break everything*
* In our
** Attitude
** Design
*** in conception and coding
** Unit tests (with Antoine)
