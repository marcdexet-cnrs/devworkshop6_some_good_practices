== What Do We Do When Developing Software?


Basically ?


[.fragment]
We just turn _human_ [.huge]#ideas#  into _computer_ [.huge]#code#


== Why A Talk About Good Practices ?

[.ppt]
* Because turning ideas into code could be tricky !
* Many ways have been tried by people,
** Some of them lead to *disaster*,
** Others to a *consensus* about how to _avoid_ disaster.

[.ppt]
* They're the *_good practices_*
** It's preferable to know some of them
** Regardless of your experience :)

== Mainly Because Of Our Human Limitations

[.ppt]
* Remember Human Brain
** First processor to turn human ideas into computer code

[.fragment]
[.ppt]
* Good Points
** It detects patterns, similarities,
** It learns, extrapolates and generalizes quickly.

[.fragment]
[.ppt]
* Not So Good Points
** Short-memory buffer,
** Reinterprets everything we say to it,
** => Cognitive and cultural.

== What Are The Challenges Of Development ?

*A REFAIRE*

* To successfully *translate* human ideas into computer code
** and vice versa
* To handle **complexity**,
* To allow changement and evolution
* To not be *afraid to break everything*
* To ensure that software is doing what it is expected to do,



== How To Handle This ?

* By following some good practices into
** Attitude
** Design
** Coding
** Testing
