== What Do We Do When Developing Software?


Basically ?


[.fragment]
We turn _human_ [.huge]#ideas#  into _computer_ [.huge]#code#


[.fragment]
[.smaller]
\...for the sake of simplicity


== Why A Talk About Good Practices ?


[.fragment]

--
[.ppt]
[.ppt]
* Thereâ€™s several ways of developing
** A lot of them have been tried by a lot of people,
** Some of them lead to *disaster*,
** Other to a *consensus* about how to _avoid_ disaster.
--
[.fragment]
--
[.ppt]
[.ppt]
* We call them the *_good practices_*
** It's preferable to follow some of them
--
[.fragment]
[.ppt]
* Because developement could be *tricky*

== Why It's So Tricky ?

[.ppt]
* Several possible reasons
** Difficult technologies,
** Rapid evolution of software concepts,
** Difficult problem to solve,

But the main cause is our human nature...

== Mainly Because Of Our Human Nature

[.fragment]
[.ppt]
* Human Brain
** First processor to turn human ideas into computer code

[.fragment]
[.ppt]
* Good Points
** It detects patterns, similarities,
** It learns, extrapolates and generalizes quickly.

[.fragment]
[.ppt]
* Not So Good Points
** Short-memory buffer limited to _"The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two"_,
** Hates repetitive tasks without interest,
** Reinterprets everything we say to him,
** => Cognitive and cultural biases we have to deal with.

And we get a lot of them...

So if we ignore our capacities, we empty the ocean with a small spoon.

== What Are The Challenges Of Development ?

* To handle **complexity**,
* To successfully *translate* human ideas into computer code
** and vice versa
* To allow changement and evolution
** To not be *afraid to break everything*
* To ensure that software is doing what is expected to do,



== How To Handle This ?

[.ppt]
* By following some good practices among a lot of them.
[.ppt]
* By applying them into these fields
** Attitude
** Design
** Coding
** Testing
