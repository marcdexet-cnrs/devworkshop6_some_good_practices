[.fragment]
No, you have all the steps but you have lost sight of the original idea.

You got lost in the translation.

You get the idea of *WHAT* you want, in a very abstract way

You think about *HOW* to get, in a little less abstract way

* Don't try to fix everything *NOW*
** Identify *WHAT* you want
