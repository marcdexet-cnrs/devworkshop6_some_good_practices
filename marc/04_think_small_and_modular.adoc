== Small Is Beautiful

Limit the required scope to take into account.

Good practices disapprove :

include::_god_class.adoc[]


== Make Small Code Units

Try to make

* Small functions -> a few tens of lines (30 max ?)
* Small classes/modules
** -> a few tens of methods (30 max ?)
** -> a few hundreds of lines (300 max ?)
* Small packages -> a few tens items (30 max ?)

Aka the _Rule of 30_
