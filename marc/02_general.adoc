Brain is not good +
at following complex branching +
or keeping _arbitrary_ references.

== Give Regularity And Consistency

Brain learns from *patterns* if they're *visible*.

* Translate *ideas* into *code*
** As the Italian say "Traduttore, traditore" -> _Translator, traitor_

[.fragment]

* Translation implies distorsion
** The further *_away_* from the _code_, the _greater_ the *distortion*.
** To _convert_ and _adapt_ into code => To _modify_ or _lost_ part of our original ideas

== Don't Be Afraid To Act

You know this fear of breaking what's working by changing a little thing.
The fear of breaking something literally *blocks* our brain.

This *fear* reflects our inability to anticipate everything in the event of a change.

So we have to deal with it and find ways to limit it.


== Freeze The Brownian Motion Of Ideas


* When turning ideas into code, we get
** Uncertainties about where to start.
** A lot of moving and unfixed ideas,
* The more _complex_ our ideas are, the more things we have to think about.

It sounds simple, +

By having to [.huge]#verbalize# some of these assumptions, +

== Verbalize What Is Spinning In Your Head

* Verbalize, describe your insights
** to a good fellow worker
*** _the poor_
** to an object, your computer, your pencil
** or a Rubber Duck

Our brain is sometime to small for so many ideas.
You have to translate your problems and concepts to somebody else.
If you don't make the effort to try, you will be the only person on earth to understand what's your doing.
And it's not good for you.
