== Do Not Overload Mental Mapping

Brain is not *good* +
at following *complex* branching or keeping *arbitrary* references.

== Give Regularity And Consistency

Brain learns from *patterns* if they're *visible*.

* Translation implies distorsion

** To _convert_ and _adapt_ into code => To _modify_ or _lost_ part of our original ideas

== The Brownian Motion Of Ideas

* When turning ideas into code, we get
** Uncertainties about
*** How to proceed,
*** The choices to be made,
*** The tools to be used,
*** ...
** A lot of _moving_ and _unfixed_ ideas,

[.fragment]
The more [.huge]_complex_ and [.huge]_ambitious_ our ideas are, +
the more [.huge]_elements_ and  [.huge]_steps_ are to think about.

[.notes]

Our brain is sometime to small for so many ideas.
You have to translate your problems and concepts to somebody else.
If you don't make the effort to try, you will be the only person on earth to understand what's your doing.
And it's not good for you.

== Don't Be Afraid To Act

The fear of breaking something literally *blocks* our brain.

image::images/marc/break_everything.gif[width=200]


[.fragment]
This *fear* reflects our inability to anticipate everything in the event of a change
in a complex context.

[.fragment]
So we have to deal with it and find ways to limit it.

You know this fear of breaking what's working by changing a little thing.
