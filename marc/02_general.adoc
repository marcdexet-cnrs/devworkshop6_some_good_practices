Our brain is sometime to small for so many ideas.
You have to translate your problems and concepts to somebody else.
If you don't make the effort to try, you will be the only person on earth to understand what's your doing.
And it's not good for you.

== Don't Be Afraid To Act

The fear of breaking something literally *blocks* our brain.

image::images/marc/break_everything.gif[width=200]


[.fragment]
This *fear* reflects our inability to anticipate everything +
in a complex context.

[.fragment]
So we have to deal with it and find ways to limit it.

You know this fear of breaking what's working by changing a little thing.

== Don't Be Afraid ...


* To go too far and be unable to go back -> *Use GIT*
* To miss side effects,
* To break a fragile building.


== Use git

*Save* each significant step, even significant *small steps*.
