== Dealing With Complexity


[.fragment]
--
* Complex vs Complicated ?
** _Complex_ as opposed to _simple_ => _indirect_,
** _Complicated_ as opposed to _easy_ => _difficult_.
--

[.fragment]
--
If _complexity_ is not a problem, _complication_ should be avoided.
--

[.fragment]
--
* Abstraction, Complixity, Complication
** The more _abstract_ are ideas, the more _complex_ is implementation.
** The more _complex_ is implementation, the more _complicated_ *may be* the code
--

[.fragment]
--
[big]#Complexity#  [.big]#Complicated#
In general, _complexity_ leads to _complication_ if you are not careful.
--

[.fragment]
--
So be careful...
--

[NOTE.notes]
--
There is always some confusion between Complex and Complicated.
Complex can be opposed to simple while complicated can be opposed to easy.
Software can be complex, because the implementation of the underlying ideas requires several steps or depths.

But such architecture is not complicated, it is just not direct.

On the contrary, a simple idea could be complicated to implement as software, could be very tricky and difficult to write, to understand.

In general, complexity leads to complication if you are not careful.

== What's this ?


Reheat the oven to 200ºC. +
Peel 1 onion. +
Place peeled onion with the mushrooms, rye bread and 1 teaspoon of ground coriander. +
Put it in a food processor and whiz until fine. +
Drain. +
Pulse in the black beans, season lightly with sea salt and black pepper. +
Divide mixture into 4 parts. +
Shape parts into patties. +
Rub each part all over with oil. +
Dust each part with ground coriander. +
Place on an oiled baking tray and roast for 25 minutes. +
Put Cheddar topping. +
Warm the rolls for the last few minutes. +
Peel and very finely chop the remaining onion with the tomatoes and place in a bowl. +
Squeeze over the lime juice. +
Add a few shakes of Tabasco and season to taste. +

* All the _steps_ to get something?
** => this is *HOW* to get something
* But do you get *WHAT* is for ?

[.fragment]
No, you have all the steps but you have lost sight of the original idea.

== Separate WHAT you want from HOW you get


[.fragment]

* Often you get a idea to _how_ to make thing
* but quicly, you could
** => get *trapped* by the details of implementation,
** => lost sight of the original idea.

To calm the incessant movement of ideas:


Think about WHAT you want to achieve +
_before_ +
you consider HOW to get it.

== From The Idea To The Solution

You get the idea of *WHAT* you want, in a very abstract way

== From The Idea To The Solution

You think about *HOW* to get, in a little less abstract way

Each _instruction_ is, itself, something you want to get

prendre une série de cas où je peux mélanger complexité et niveau d'abstraction

== Breakdown Big Problem

[NOTE.notes]
--
* Your brain is not well built to maintain heavy concepts and many irritating details.
* Break problem down to little problems
* => conception
--

== Flexibility

[NOTE.notes]
--
* Delimit the perimeter
* Tell What it does, don't think about how it's done.
* Engage for interface, not (yet) about implementation
* Keep the freedom of experimentating
* => interface
