== Remember

First of all, we have to never forget that if computer make code running, human make the code, so...

== Slide with human

Yes you've already seen this, maybe, but it's still true, so I repeat again.

== Human First

[NOTE.notes]

* Don't talk about programing langage at first, talk about concepts.

Good programmers write code
that humans can understand

=== Do Not Generate Dissonance

_Recopier le slide du DevWorkshop 5_


=== Do Not Overload Mental Mapping

_Recopier le slide du DevWorkshop 5_

Brain is not good
at following complex branching
or keeping arbitrary references.

=== Give Regularity And Consistency

_Recopier le slide du DevWorkshop 5_

Brain learns from patterns if they're visible.


== Now


== Freeze The Brownian Motion Of Ideas

* In our times, we have to work in parallele
* A lot of moving and unfixed ideas

[NOTE.notes]

* The conception is like a game.
* We all of us have a lot of ideas.
* We all of us have biases.
* "ecrire c'est ranger le bordel qu'on a dans la tÃªte"
* "writing is putting away the mess in your head"
* "to describe is to put away the mess in your head"
* => Draw boxes with arrows
* => write down what do you want to do
* Talk to your colleges

== Part about How to Design


== Breakdown Big Problem

[NOTE.notes]
--
* Your brain is not well built to maintain heavy concepts and many irritating details.
* Break problem down to little problems
* => conception

== Flexibility

[NOTE.notes]
--
* Delimit the perimeter
* Tell What it does, don't think about how it's done.
* Engage for interface, not (yet) about implementation
* Keep the freedom of experimentating
* => interface
