## Introduction

### Why good practices

* What's is development ?
  * it's turning ideas into code
* There's several way of doing it
  * This is path followed by a lot of people
* Some way of doing make consensus et must be followed
* Because it could be tricky

### What are the challenges ?

* to master the complexity
* To translate well the idea into code
* To be sure the code does what it expected to do
* To master the changeability
* Do not break everything

### Why it so tricky ?

* human brain

## What to do ?

### Tenir compte du cerveau

Lister ce que aime le cerveau

### Ne pas ignorer nos propres défaillances
* Take time
* Calm down the mess in our brain

### Quelles sont les relations entre tout ces éléments

complexité => complication => confiance 

##  Mastering complexity

To master complexity, you have to break down big problem into small problems.

### Think WHAT before HOW

### Group by concern

### Isolate components so you can focus on them

* module
* package
* namespace
* OOP

### Separation of level of abstraction

* Scaling zoom in and out
* It follows the WHAT -> HOW ladder

### Limit required knowledge
## Manage flexibility 

* flexibility for change
* flexibility for evolution
* Don't break everything 

### Give you flexibility

* thigly coupled architecture has not flexibility.
* It can not change

### Loosen coupling

### Injection of depencencies

## Think contract

### Limit required knowledge

#### Segregation of interface

## Ensure stability
### Open/closed

### Liskvov

## Focus
### Single Responsability

### Dependency inversion

## When writting

### Read first

### Refactoring
