== Fixtures

When setup is more complex, it is better to outsource it from the unit test itself.

This is what we call a *fixture* by analogy to hardware testing.

[.fragment]
In general, fixtures are classes which are instanciated at test setup.

=== Test vector addition with random values

More flexibility without duplication:
Test vector addition with varying random values.

[source, python]
----
class RandomListVector(ListVector):
    
    def __init__(self, size=None):
        self.input_size = size
        if size is None:
            self.input_size = random.randrange(1, 10)
        self.input_data = [random.random() for i in range(self.input_size)]
        super().__init__(self.input_data)
----

[.fragment]
[source, python]
----
class TestListVector(object):
    
    @classmethod
    def setup_class(cls):
        # Let's instantiate an empty vector and two random vectors of same size
        cls.empty = RandomListVector(0)
        cls.random_a = RandomListVector()
        cls.random_b = RandomListVector(len(cls.random_a))

    def test_addition(self):
        s = self.random_a + self.random_b
        for s_i, a_i, b_i in zip(s, self.random_a, self.random_b):
            assert s_i == a_i + b_i

[.step]
* This works... [.fragment]#but we are coupling things at setup which are not coherent.#
* Why creating an empty vector along with a random vector or two while they do not interact in the tests?
