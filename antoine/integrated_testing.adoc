== Integrated unit testing

At integrated unit testing level, several classes interface.
Yet, as opposed to higher-level integration tests,
the class under testing (primary) in a given test suite is still *unique*.


[.fragment]
When a test of the primary class doesn't pass, how to know in which class the issue lies?

[.fragment]
We propose here an example of such dependency by implementing a Histogram class.

=== Histogram description

A histogram maps contiguous intervals to counts.

It is made of value bins (the x-axis) and counts (the y-axis), which are implemented as Vectors.

Here's an artist view of a histogram whose x-axis is stored as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8] and y-axis as [10, 20, 50, 60, 40, 30]:

--
* The count associated to value 2 -- which lies in bin [2-3) -- is 20.
* That of value 10 is 0.
--

=== Histogram requirements

* The count of value v is counts[i] iff bins[i] â‰¤ v < bins[i].
* The count of a value outside the provided value range is 0.

=== The problem: Two implementations of a vector

* How should we instantiate our histogram fixtures?
** With a Python list?
** With a Numpy array?
** With both?
* What if we give up an implementation?
* What if a third implementation of Vector is provided?
